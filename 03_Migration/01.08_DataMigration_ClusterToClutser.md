# Data Migration (Non-cluster to cluster)

## Setup

Follow all the steps in the [Setup](./../05_Appendix/00_Setup.md) guide to create an environment to support the following steps.

## Disable AOF

Follow the `Disable AOF in the target` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Data

In many cases you may be moving from a clustered Redis server to an Azure Cache for Redis cluster.  This is similar to executing a single instance to single instance migration.

- Run the following to migrate the keys in a cluster instance to an Azure cluster:

```bash
TBD
```

### Check success

Depending on the size of the file, it could take a while for the import to finish.  Once it is completed, verify that all keys have been migrated.

Follow the `Check success` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Enable AOF in Target

Follow the `Enable AOF in the target` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Summary - Backup and Restore

Even a simple backup and restore operation can potentially require significant effort to restore to an Azure Cache for Redis instance (such as with clusters).

Practice the above steps and record the time it takes to complete the entire migration. In most cases, you should be able to script the migration process.
