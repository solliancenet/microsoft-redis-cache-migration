# Data Migration (Non-cluster to cluster)

## Setup

Follow all the steps in the [Setup](./../05_Appendix/00_Setup.md) guide to create an environment to support the following steps.

## Disable AOF

Follow the `Disable AOF in the target` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Data

In many cases you may be moving from a clustered Redis server to an Azure Cache for Redis cluster.  This is similar to executing a single instance to single instance migration.  The setup scripts for the images will create basic Redis instances, but also create a cluster running on ports 30001-30007 (three mains, three replicas).

- Run the following to get all the keys in a cluster:

    ```bash
    redis-cli --cluster call localhost:30001 KEYS "*"
    ```

- To migrate the keys in a cluster instance to an Azure cluster, run the following script:

    ```bash
    sudo nano cluster-migrate.sh
    ```

- Copy the following into it:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    dbs=$(redis-cli -h localhost -p 30001 config get databases)
    items=$(sed "s/databases//" <<< $dbs)

    for (( count=0; count<1; count++))
    do
        OLD="redis-cli --cluster call localhost:30001 KEYS \"*\""

        NEW="redis-cli -h <REDIS_NAME>.redis.cache.windows.net -a <REDIS_KEY>"

        RAW=$($OLD)

        #get all the server names
        echo $RAW

        COUNT=0

        #loop all the servers
        for TMP in $RAW; do

            ((COUNT++))

            if [[ $COUNT < 5 ]]
                then
                        continue
            fi

            #echo $TMP

            IFS=':' read -ra VALS <<< "$TMP"

            HOST=${VALS[0]}
            PORT=${VALS[1]}

            #echo $HOST
            #echo $PORT

            #get the keys in each cluster host
            KEYS=$(redis-cli -h $HOST -p $PORT --scan)

            for KEY in $KEYS; do

                redis-cli -h $HOST -p $PORT --raw DUMP "$KEY" | head -c-1 > /tmp/dump
                TTL=$(redis-cli -h $HOST -p $PORT --raw TTL "$KEY")

                #skip items that are moved - on replica nodes
                if [[ $TTL == *"MOVED"* ]]; then
                        continue;
                fi

                case $TTL in
                        -2)
                        $NEW DEL "$KEY"
                        ;;
                        -1)
                        $NEW DEL "$KEY"
                        cat /tmp/dump | $NEW -x RESTORE "$KEY" 0
                        ;;
                        *)
                        $NEW DEL "$KEY"
                        cat /tmp/dump | $NEW -x RESTORE "$KEY" "$TTL"
                        ;;
                esac

            echo "$HOST $PORT $KEY (TTL = $TTL)"
            done
        done
    done
    ```

- Save the script, run it:

    ```bash
    sudo bash cluster-migrate.sh
    ```

## Check success

Depending on the size of the file, it could take a while for the import to finish.  Once it is completed, verify that all keys have been migrated.

Follow the `Check success` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Enable AOF in Target

Follow the `Enable AOF in the target` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Summary - Backup and Restore

Even a simple backup and restore operation can potentially require significant effort to restore to an Azure Cache for Redis instance (such as with clusters).

Practice the above steps and record the time it takes to complete the entire migration. In most cases, you should be able to script the migration process.
