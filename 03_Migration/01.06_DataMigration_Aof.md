# Option 6 - Data Migration with Append Only File (AOF)

## Setup

Follow all the steps in the [Setup](./../05_Appendix/00_Setup.md) guide to create an environment to support the following steps.

## Disable AOF

Follow the `Disable AOF in the target` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Data Setup

- Check the contents of the AOF file, you should see an empty file:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /var/lib/redis/appendonly.aof
    ```

- Add some cache values:

    ```bash
    redis-cli set Key1 "Key1"
    ```

- Run the following command to enable AOF on the source, you also need to disable the `aof-use-rdb-preamble`:

    ```bash
    redis-cli config set aof-use-rdb-preamble no

    redis-cli config set appendonly yes
    ```

- Make some changes:

    ```bash
    redis-cli set Key2 "Key2"
    redis-cli set Key3 "Key3"
    ```

- Check the contents of the AOF file, you should now see the `Key2` and `Key3` changes, but notice no `Key1` item:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /var/lib/redis/appendonly.aof
    ```

- Tell Redis to regenerate the AOF File:

    ```bash
    redis-cli BGREWRITEAOF
    ```

- To check for errors or the status of the background save, run the following:

    ```bash
    sudo tail /var/log/redis/redis-server.log -n 100
    ```

- Once you have a fresh AOF file, flush the target to start from scratch

    ```bash
    redis-cli -h <REDIS_IP> -p <REDIS_PORT> -a <REDIS_PWD> flushall
    ```

- Import the AOF file from the source

    ```bash
    sudo cat /var/lib/redis/appendonly.aof | sudo redis-cli -h <REDIS_IP> -p <REDIS_PORT> -a <REDIS_PWD> --pipe
    ```

### Check success

Depending on the size of the file, it could take a while for the import to finish.  Once it is completed, verify that all keys have been migrated.

Follow the `Check success` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Enable AOF in Target

Follow the `Enable AOF in the target` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Summary - Backup and Restore

Even a simple backup and restore operation can potentially require significant effort to restore to an Azure Cache for Redis instance.

Practice the above steps and record the time it takes to complete the entire migration.
