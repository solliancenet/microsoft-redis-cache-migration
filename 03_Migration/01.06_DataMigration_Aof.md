# Data Migration with Append Only File (AOF)

## Setup

Follow all the steps in the [Setup](./../05_Appendix/00_Setup.md) guide to create an environment to support the following steps.

## Disable AOF in Target

To speed up the import, be sure to disable AOF in the target instance.

- Run the following on the target:

```bash
redis-cli config set appendonly no
```

## Data

### Enable AOF in Source

- Add some cache values:

```bash
redis-cli set Key1 "Key1"
```

- Run the following command to find where your RDB file is located:

```bash
redis-cli config set appendonly yes
```

- Check the contents of the AOF file:

```bash
sudo nano /var/lib/redis/appendonly.aof
```

- Make some changes:

```bash
redis-cli set Key2 "Key2"
redis-cli set Key3 "Key3"
```

- If necessary, flush the target to start from scratch

```bash
redis-cli -h <REDIS_IP> -p <REDIS_PORT> -a <REDIS_PWD> flushall
```

- Import the AOF file from the source

```bash
redis-cli -h <REDIS_IP> -p <REDIS_PORT> -a <REDIS_PWD> --pipe < appendonly.aof
```

### Check success

- Depending on the size of the file, it could take a while for the import to finish.  Once it is completed, verify that all keys have been migrated.

## Enable AOF in Target

If you disabled AOF in the target, re-enable it:

- Run the following on the target:

```bash
redis-cli config set appendonly yes
```

## Summary - Backup and Restore

Even a simple backup and restore operation can potentially require significant effort to restore to an Azure Cache for Redis instance.

Practice the above steps and record the time it takes to complete the entire migration.
