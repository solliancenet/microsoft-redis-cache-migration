# Data Migration with Redis Replication

## Setup

Follow all the steps in the [Setup](./../05_Appendix/00_Setup.md) guide to create an environment to support the following steps.

> **Note** If the server is not enabled for SSL, it is highly recommended that it is configured.  See [Configure Redis for SSL connectivity](../05_Appendix/04_ConfigurePostgresSSL.md) to enable SSL for the instance.

## Replication setup

Logical replication will send only the changes that occur in real-time to the subscriber.  This means an initial synchronization will be required before enabling the replication.

### Backup and Restore the instance

- Using the steps in the [Backup and Restore path](./01.01_DataMigration_BackupRestore.md), backup the instance and restore it.

### Setup Replication
