# Data Migration with Redis Replication

## Setup

Follow all the steps in the [Setup](./../05_Appendix/00_Setup.md) guide to create an environment to support the following steps.

> **Note** If the server is not enabled for SSL, it is highly recommended that it is configured.  See [Configure Redis for SSL connectivity](../05_Appendix/04_ConfigurePostgresSSL.md) to enable SSL for the instance.

## Replication setup

- On the target server, run the following:

```bash
replicaof source_hostname_or_ip source_port
```

- Once replication has completed, run the following on the target:

```bash
replicaof no one
```

> TODO - does this work on Azure Redis???
