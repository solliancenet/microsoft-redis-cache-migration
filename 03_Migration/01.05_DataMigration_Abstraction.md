# Data Migration with Layer of Abstraction

If migrating an entire Redis instance is not feasible or worth the extra effort, you can add a layer of abstraction in your application code that can be enabled or disabled via configuration.

This extra layer of code will be responsible for retrieving the cache value from the source instance, and adding it to the destination instance.  You can set a threshold for the number of key coverage (such as 90%) you are targeting and once that is hit, you can change the application to start pulling values from the new instance.

## Example

In the following .NET code, you will modify your application to add code that still returns the cache value from the source, but also does the extra work to save the value to the new instance.

- Open the `RedisWeb` project
- Open the `CacheHelper.cs` file
- In the `public static void SetData<T>(string key, T data)` method, add the following code:

```csharp
if (mode == "Migrate")
{
    //send the value to the target
    SetData<T>(key, data, destDb);
}
```

- In the `public static T GetData<T>(string key)` method, add the following code:

```csharp
if (mode == "Migrate")
{
    //send the value to the target
    SetData<T>(key, data, destDb);
}
```

- Modify the `appsettings.json` to set the `REDIS_CONNECTION` and `REDIS_TARGET_CONNECTION` values
- Set the `REDIS_MODE` value to `Migrate`
- Compile the project
- Press **F5** to run the project

> **NOTE** It is important to ensure that the save operation to the new instance is `async` to prevent any application performance issues.
