# Data Migration with Redis (Mass Insertion)

## Setup

Follow all the steps in the [Setup](./../05_Appendix/00_Setup.md) guide to create an environment to support the following steps.

## Connectivity Setup

In order to connect to Azure Redis, you must either enable non-SSL port, or you must install a tunneling tool such as [STunnel](./../05_Appendix/03_InstallStunnel.md).

> **NOTE** The following approaches move all databases from the target to the source.  If you are migrating to a cluster, it has only one database `0` and you'll need to adjust the scripts accordingly.  However, if you have any key overlap between databases, the order of these are from smallest to greatest, so the higher number database will win out.

### Enable Non-SSL Port

- Open the Azure Portal
- Browse to the Azure Cache for Redis
- Select **Non--SSL port (6379) disabled** link
- Select to enable the port
- Select **Save**

## Disable AOF

Follow the `Disable AOF in the target` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Mass Insertion (SET)

- Run the following command to export all keys and values to a file
- Start a PowerShell session:

    ```bash
    pwsh
    ```

- Run the following to dump all the keys and values:

    ```powershell
    $databases = $(redis-cli config get databases)[1];

    for ($i = 0; $i -lt $databases; $i++)
    {
        del "set_$i.txt";

        $keys = redis-cli -n $i keys "*"

        foreach($key in $keys)
        {
            $val = redis-cli get $key

            $line = $key + "`t" + $val;
            add-content "set_$i.txt" $line;
        }
    }
    ```

- Run the following command to import all keys and values

    ```powershell
    $databases = $(redis-cli config get databases)[1];

    for ($i = 0; $i -lt $databases; $i++)
    {
        $lines = get-content "set_$i.txt";

        foreach($line in $lines)
        {
            $vals = $line.split("`t");

            $key = $vals[0];
            $val = $vals[1];

            $ret = $val | redis-cli -a <REDIS_PWD> -h <REDIS_NAME>.redis.cache.windows.net -n $i set $key $val;

            Write-Host "Setting database $i : $key to $val";
        }
    }
    ```

> **NOTE** This approach will lose important metadata such as Time To Live (TTL) settings that may be set in the source. You should also be sure that all values that are export and then re-imported are encoded in a way that ensures valid values imported into the target instance.

## Mass Insertion (DUMP/RESTORE)

- In the SSH window for the **PREFIX-redis01** virtual machine, run the following:

    ```bash
    sudo nano restore.sh
    ```

- Paste the following into the file, be sure to replace the target Azure Cache for Redis details:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    dbs=$(redis-cli config get databases)
    items=$(sed "s/databases//" <<< $dbs)

    for (( count=0; count<items; count++))
    do
        OLD="redis-cli -h localhost"
        NEW="redis-cli -h cjg-redis-basic6.redis.cache.windows.net -a 9g8zuaLGWK0YLxGnzQiVWeR+ba5kz+hPdaHqcPauHC8="

        for KEY in $($OLD -n $count --scan); do
            $OLD -n $count --raw DUMP "$KEY" | head -c-1 > /tmp/dump
            TTL=$($OLD -n $count --raw TTL "$KEY")
            case $TTL in
                -2)
                    $NEW -n $count DEL "$KEY"
                    ;;
                -1)
                    $NEW -n $count DEL "$KEY"
                    cat /tmp/dump | $NEW -n $count -x RESTORE "$KEY" 0
                    ;;
                *)
                    $NEW -n $count DEL "$KEY"
                    cat /tmp/dump | $NEW -n $count -x RESTORE "$KEY" "$TTL"
                    ;;
            esac
            echo "$count $KEY (TTL = $TTL)"
        done
    done
    ```

> **NOTE** Add the `-c` option if running against a cluster as the source or target.

- Save the file and exit the editor
- Run the migration:

    ```bash
    sudo bash restore.sh
    ```

> **NOTE** The target versions should be the same, or have similar encoding of the values in order for the DUMP/RESTORE command to succeed.

## Mass Insertion (MIGRATE)

You can use the `MIGRATE` command to move key values to a new instance. In terms of the details, this command actually executes a DUMP+DEL in the source instance, and a RESTORE in the target instance.  This path is very risky as it will remove the keys from the source as it processes them.

- Create a new script:

    ```bash
    sudo nano migrate.sh
    ```

- Paste the following, replace the Redis information:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    dbs=$(redis-cli config get databases)
    items=$(sed "s/databases//" <<< $dbs)

    for (( count=0; count<items; count++))
    do
        OLD="redis-cli -h localhost"
        
        for KEY in $($OLD -n $count --scan); do

                #$($OLD -n $count --scan) | xargs redis-cli MIGRATE cjg-redis-prem.redis.cache.windows.net 6379 "" $cou$
                RESULT=$($OLD -n $count MIGRATE <REDIS_NAME>.redis.cache.windows.net <REDIS_PORT>) $KEY $count 15000 AUTH "<REDIS_PWD>"
                
                echo "$count $KEY $RESULT"
        done
        echo "$count"
    done
    ```

  - Run the script:

    ```bash
    sudo bash migrate.sh
    ```

> **NOTE** The target versions should be the same, or have similar encoding of the values in order for the MIGRATE command to succeed.

### Check success

Depending on the size of the file, it could take a while for the import to finish.  Once it is completed, verify that all keys have been migrated.

Follow the `Check success` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).

## Enable AOF in Target

Follow the `Enable AOF in the target` steps in the [common tasks article](03_DataMigration_Common.md).
