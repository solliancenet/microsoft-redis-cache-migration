# Summary

This document has covered several topics related to migrating an application from on-premises Redis to Azure Cache for Redis.  We covered how to begin and assess the project all the way to application cut over.  

The migration team will need to review the topics carefully as the choices made can have project timeline effects. The total cost of ownership is very attractive given the many enterprise ready features provided.

The migration project approach is very important.  The team will need to assess the application and instance complexity to determine the amount of conversion time.  Conversion tools will help make the transition easier, but there will always be an element of manual review and updates required.  Scripting out pre-migration tasks and post migration testing is important.

Application architecture and design can provide strong indicators as to the level of effort required. For example, being able to add a layer of abstraction for moving cache data at runtime.

In the end, several tools exist in the marketplace ranging from free to commercial.  This document covered the steps required if the team plans a instance migration using one of the more popular open source tool options.  Whichever path that is chosen, Microsoft and the Redis community have the tools and expertise to make the instance migration successful.
